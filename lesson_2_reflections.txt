//Question 1
What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need
to do it?

All the files you have in the directory now fall under the 
supervision of git, and allow commits and certain git 
commands like git diff and git log to take place. This is
essential because now you are able to view different
versions of the program with ease.


//Question 2
How is the staging area different from the working directory
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows me to take a subset of the files in
my original folder and the commit only the files that I 
want at that time. I think that is the most efficient way
to transfer over files into a new repository.
