//Question 1
When would you want to create a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?

An obvious example lies with a group project, when everyone 
needs a place to keep and update files and where everyone can
view them and the changes made.

//Question 2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

There may be experimental code placed on Github by a coworker
that you may not think is necessary. If Git automatically made
you pull those changes it could get pretty annoying

//Question 3
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

Branches simply relate to the chain of commits on your local
repository. Cloning involves copying ones entire repository
and moving it to your local workstation. Forking is an 
application of Github and allows you to copy ones repository
and move it to your own workspace on Github. From there you can
clone it to your local computer.
