//Question 1
When would you want to create a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?

An obvious example lies with a group project, when everyone 
needs a place to keep and update files and where everyone can
view them and the changes made.

//Question 2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

There may be experimental code placed on Github by a coworker
that you may not think is necessary. If Git automatically made
you pull those changes it could get pretty annoying
